RUNNING THE SIMULATION

To start the simulation, enter the following in the command line:

>> java -jar ../logist/logist.jar config/reactive.xml <agent-name>

To run the simulation with two agents, enter:

>> java -jar ../logist/logist.jar config/reactive.xml <agent-name-1> <agent-name-2>

where <agent-name> corresponds to the agent name defined for the agent in agents.xml (e.g. reactive-random)
